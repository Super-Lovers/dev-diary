<p class="description"><span class="drop">I</span>n Candles, You are a girl called Jane that is struggling with an unfortunate relationship with her family and to cope, she decides it is time to go, and so your adventure to escape begins. This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2019 in two days. In Candles, we wanted to capture a spooky vibe and create a narrative-based progression game. Naturally, we went the RPG Maker route but for the sake of development experience at working on a new genre, I decided to program it with Unity instead. The entire programming will be re-written in the future because it was one of my first games and I had little to no experience of what was right or wrong to do.</p>

The game starts off with the player in the bedroom and having little to no options other than interacting with objects in the room. Most if not all of the programming revolves on the interaction with objects. If the player interacts with object A, then option or possibility B is now on the table. Super simple idea, which to my peanut brain in early 2019 was apparently not simple. Using candles in the game, the player can enter a new spooky dimension where he has more options to progress the story:

The idea is that the player has to learn to make use of this transportation mechanic to progress the story where normally he wouldn't be able to. This world transformation works by assigning to each object sprites for both possible states of existence, in the normal and spooky dimension. The parents of the player character are the antagonists and the player has to avoid them by changing dimensions and hiding.

The player finishes the game when he finally escapes the haunted house and scary parents (dramatic).
