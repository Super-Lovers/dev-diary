<p class="description">GrounDead is a top-down zombie survival game, wherein the player takes control of a hunter/lumberjack/carpenter, who must survive waves of zombies coming towards him with the use of multiple weapons, such a  hunting rifle, a knife, an axe, and by crafting a variety of different defensive structures, such as barricades, platforms, and traps. To control the character, the player will use a traditional keyboard and mouse control scheme to perform actions, such as moving, attacking, building, destroying and healing.
