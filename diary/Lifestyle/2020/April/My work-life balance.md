<span class="drop">S</span> ometimes I get asked how I spend my time at home when I am not at the university or at workplace. You read and hear a lot about work-life balance on the internet and it is an important factor for spending your time productively and improving your lifestyle. With the COVID-19 situation developing right now, I thought it fitting to share how I struggle and spend my time at home to find this balance.

Since programmers spend much of their time sitting, it is important we exercise regularly to stay healthy and thusly improve productivity/learning ability. Currently, it is difficult, if not impossible, to do outdoor activities such as jogging, walking and biking. Normally, that is what I do, but now I transitioned to indoor exercises, 99% involving body-weight and others using elastic bands of varying size.

Because you can't go to a fitness, you have to bring the fitness to you. I had to get a fitness mat to exercise safely at home because the floor or bed is not suitable and even if they are suitable, it is much more motivating to me that I get in the zone/mood of exercising by having equipment or a mat to use. It is about feeling like you are in a gym and getting into the mindset and staying there for as long as you can.

Programming-wise, there are no changes because of the pandemic. When I am done with university work, I try to learn new tools/languages/environments and to improve my general programming skills (hard/soft). There are many lists of small and large project ideas that you can make to practice and learn. For me, it is more effective to create projects from scratch and getting used to the development workflow for each compared to solving programming challenges. Simple projects and app ideas like making a this-or-that or pomodoro application in a day or two can teach you a lot because you are solving problems with scale and depth larger than in some programming challenges. With that said,  I try to spend time and learn algorithmic problems from sites like codewars and leetcode, since you always need to stay sharp in problem-solving situations. 

My biggest struggle is removing distractions like social media and cutting my friends off or when they ask me to play games. Now that everyone is home due to the pandemic, we are staying in touch much more than before while I was studying/working, so it is hard for me to not join in with them. Normally I'd say I am at the university or work, but that is not an option at the moment. This period has shown me (as a student) that I have to work on my diligence at home and not become too lax, so you should too if you are not already.
