### Creating a bookmarks CLI app
##### Uploaded on 21st February, 2020

<span class="drop">W</span>hen you bookmark online pages like me all the time and switch browsers a lot, it becomes irritating to get used to every browser's different implementation of a bookmarks viewer interface. That's why I decided to make one called SLBMS where it won't matter what browser i'm using. When you use Linux, Mac or Windows, the one thing that stays constant is having a console, which is why I thought about making my bookmarks application a CLI in Node.js. I'm not very good at Node.js so the implementation is not great and is fairly simple in design, which is why I call it a viewer rather than a manager app. 

SLBMS uses the bookmarks html files that browsers allow you to export as a backup to give you different actions to explore your bookmarks.
